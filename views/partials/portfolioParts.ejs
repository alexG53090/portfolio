                Fly-Buy shows users the price paid, dates, airline, flight number,

                real-world need consumers have, which is the ability to make informed purchases of airline

                the information one needs to know whether or not they got a good deal and how to get a better deal
                in the future.

                Trail Mix is a modern, full-stack web-application. Trail Mix arose from a real-world need hikers have,
                which is to know relevant information about a hike before actually hiking the trail. Taking our users’
                needs and lifestyles to heart, we crafted a mobile-first design. Before writing a single line of code,
                our team pored over countless wireframes, making sure the UX would be sleek and intuitive.
              </p>
              <p class="long-description">
                By keeping the scope of the project simple, our team was able to provide attention to every detail and execute the idea
                all the way through so that the Trail Mix software supports every use-case, even the null use cases.
                On the back end of the app, we ensure the security of our users through the use of Google social
                authentication,
              </p>
              <p class="long-description">
                which not only authenticates each user but also provides a seamless and secure experience
                by protecting and persisting their personal information all the way through each session. As a result of
                the decision to build the app using JavaScript all the way through the stack, our product is fast and is
                supported by all browsers. Won’t you check it out? https://www.trailmix.in
